# Space Solutions - Mars Colonization Project

This project is part of an HND program, aiming to design and develop a database management system for the Mars colonization project. The system is built using C# WPF for the front-end and MySQL for the database. It manages information about colonists, their families, space crafts (E-Jets), trips to Mars, houses on Mars, and jobs assigned to colonists.

## Features

- **Colonist Management**: Records detailed information about each colonist, including their qualifications, family details, and contact information.
- **Family Management**: Each colonist can take their family as dependents, with details stored according to the colonist.
- **Space Craft Management**: Manages different types of E-Jets, their specifications, and trips to Mars.
- **Trip Management**: Details of trips, including the Jet code, launch date, and return date.
- **House Assignment**: Assigns houses on Mars to colonists and their families based on the number of members.
- **Job Assignment**: Assigns different jobs (e.g., construction, medical, research) to colonists as part of the Mars colonization process.

## Technologies Used

- **C# WPF**: Used for building the front-end of the application.
- **MySQL**: Used to store and manage data about colonists, families, trips, space crafts, and jobs.
- **Entity Framework**: Used for database interaction and ORM (optional if implemented).
